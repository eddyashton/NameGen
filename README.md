# NameGen

A repo for exploration of the generation of _pronounceable names_.

Given some unpronounceable input string (a hash digest, a 256-bit number, a monotonic user ID), can we generate pronounceable (memorable, human-distinct) identifiers algorithmically? How do we trade-off uniqueness (collision-resistance) against this concept of pronounceability? How do we measure it?
